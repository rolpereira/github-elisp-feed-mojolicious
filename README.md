Inspired by Zach's
[feed for new Common Lisp repos](http://xach.livejournal.com/298220.html).

The code was based on [tempire's example of a Mojolicious app hosted in heroku](http://tempire.github.io/mojolicious-command-deploy-heroku/).

You can find the feed in [Gwene.org](http://gwene.org) with the name `gwene.com.herokuapp.github-elisp`
